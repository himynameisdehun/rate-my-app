# rate-my-app
A helper to increment store's ratings by displaying a rate dialog at the right time.

I decided to create this little cute thing because getting reviews and feedback from app's users is very important for both development and marketing, but it's also quiet difficult to obtain spontaneously.

This is a helper that will encourage app's users to rate the app by displaying a dialog when the probability to get a positive feedback are higher.
